			  The way in which people work today has changed signi
		  cantly since businesses started using encryption products
		  to secure their data. On average we each have 2.9 devices
		  that we expect to be able to use for work purposes. And we
		  don’t just work from the of ce. We work from home, the car,
		  the airport, the café and we need our data to keep up with
		  us, and to stay secure whichever platform or device we
		  choose. This survey was conducted to better understand
		  where businesses are succeeding with using encryption to
		  secure their data. It also identi es gaps in organizations’
		  encryption strategies as we continue moving toward a
		  business world that demands secure access to data wherever
		  the user is and whichever device they choose to use.

		  Messages between WhatsApp users are protected with an end-
	  to-end encryption protocol so that third parties and WhatsApp
	  cannot read them and so that the messages can only be decrypted
	  by the recipient  All types of WhatsApp messages (including
	  chats, group chats, images, videos, voice messages and  les)
	  and WhatsApp calls are protected by end-to-end encryption
	  WhatsApp servers do not have access to the private keys of
	  WhatsApp users, and WhatsApp users have the option to verify
	  keys in order to ensure the integrity of their communication.
	  The Signal Protocol library used by WhatsApp is Open Source,
	  available here: https://github
	  com/whispersystems/libsignal-protocol-java/


	  Transport Security All communication between WhatsApp clients
  and WhatsApp servers is layered within a separate encrypted channel
   On Windows Phone, iPhone, and Android, those end-to-end encryption
  capable clients use Noise Pipes with Curve25519, AES-GCM, and
  SHA256 from the Noise Protocol Framework for long running
  interactive connections. This provides clients with a few nice
  properties: 1  Extremely fast lightweight connection setup and
  resume 2  Encrypts metadata to hide it from unauthorized network
  observers. No information about the connecting user’s identity is
  revealed 3  No client authentication secrets are stored on the
  server  Clients authenticate themselves using a Curve25519 key
  pair, so the server only stores a client’s public authentication
  key. If the server’s user database is ever compromised, no private
  authentication credentials will be revealed
